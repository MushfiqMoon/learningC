/*
One day, Ali Baba had an easy puzzle that he couldn't solve. The puzzle consisted of 4
 numbers and his task was to check whether he could get the fourth number using arithmetic operators (+,−,×
) between the other three numbers; so that each operator is used only once.

a□b□c=d
Can you solve this tricky puzzle for him?
Input
Only one line containing four numbers a
, b
, c
 and d
 (−109≤a,b,c≤109
),(−1018≤d≤1018
).

Output
Print "YES" (without quotes) if you get the fourth number using arithmetic operators, otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

Examples
input
3 4 5 23
output
YES

input
9 5 3 7
output
YES

input
1 2 3 1
output
NO
